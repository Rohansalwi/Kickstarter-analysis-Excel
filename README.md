# Analysis of kickstarter campaign
Performing analysis on kickstarter data

## Overview of Project
The Kickstarter_challenge is a historical data dump which has different campaigns from different countries and from different categories of visual entertainment with their specific outcomes and the amount they made and if they achieved their respective goals. Louise estimates that her play will cost $12,000 and would like to use this data to validate her estimation.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to organize the data so that it is more legible and generate insights so we can use data from the Pledged column to research projects with a similar monetary goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
No challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the analysis of theatre outcomes by launch date, 61% of total plays produced in the past 9 years from 2009 to 2017 were successful

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the analysis of outcomes based on Goals, 54.17% of the plays produced within a budget between 10,000 and less than 15,000 were successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. The success rate of producing a play is almost double than the cancelled and failed ones.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset includes historical information from various countries and does not focus on any one.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
